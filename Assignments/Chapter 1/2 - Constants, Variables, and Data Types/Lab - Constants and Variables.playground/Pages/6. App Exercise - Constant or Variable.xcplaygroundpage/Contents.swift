## App Exercise - Fitness Tracker: Constant or Variable?
 
 >These exercises reinforce Swift concepts in the context of a fitness tracking app.
 
 There are all sorts of things that a fitness tracking app needs to keep track of in order to display the right information to the user. Similar to the last exercise, declare either a constant or a variable for each of the following items, and assign each a sensible value. Be sure to use proper naming conventions.
 
- Name: The user's name
- Age: The user's age
- Number of steps taken today: The number of steps that a user has taken today
- Goal number of steps: The user's goal for number of steps to take each day
- Average heart rate: The user's average heart rate over the last 24 hours

var userName = "Charlie"
print("I chose a variable because a person can change their name.")
let userAge = 20
print("I chose a constant because a person can not change their age.")
var stepsTaken = 2000
print("I chose a variable because the person may add to their daily steps.")
var stepsGoal = 10000
print ("I chose a variable because a persons daily goal may change.")
var averageHeartRate = 100
print("I chose a variable because a persons average heart rate will change")
/*:
 Now go back and add a line after each constant or variable declaration. On those lines, print a statement explaining why you chose to declare the piece of information as a constant or variable.
